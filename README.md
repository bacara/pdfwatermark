Watermark PDF documents

pdfwatermark is a simple, yet effective tool to watermark your personal
documents before handing them to some people/corporation.

While it might be sufficient for most people at most time in life, the increased
security provided by this software is absolutely not bullet-proof, nor even
guaranted. Use at your own risks.

## Usage
